# Face-Recognition-based-on-FHE
This is the Fully Homomorphic Encryption technic using on the face recognition
First, you need to add images to the file and then run the FACE DETECTION file. This will generate a .yml file in the trainer folder.
These are the libraries you may need to follow:
PIL-Tools	1.1.0	
PyYAML	6.0.2	
attrs	24.3.0	
certifi	2024.12.14	
charset-normalizer	3.4.1	
contourpy	1.3.1	
contrib	0.3.0	
cycler	0.12.1	
fonttools	4.55.3	
idna	3.10	
jsonschema	4.23.0	
jsonschema-specifications	2024.10.1	
kiwisolver	1.4.8	
matplotlib	3.10.0	
numpy	2.2.1	
opencv-contrib-python	4.10.0.84	
opencv-python	4.10.0.84	
packaging	24.2	
pillow	11.0.0	
pip	23.2.1	
pyparsing	3.2.0	
python-dateutil	2.9.0.post0	
referencing	0.35.1	
requests	2.32.3	
rpds-py	0.22.3	
setuptools	68.2.0	
six	1.17.0	
urllib3	2.3.0	
wheel	0.41.2	
By the way, you need to create the 'trainer' and 'save file' folders to separately store the trainer.yml file and the images you uploaded.
After completing the above steps, the operations on the Windows system are done. Except for the first two files, the subsequent files are implemented on Linux Ubuntu.
You need to call Microsoft's SEAL fully homomorphic encryption library in Linux. I don't know how to upload a folder on GitHub, but this step is not difficult, so you need to install it yourself.
Once you generate the process_data.yaml file, you can proceed with fully homomorphic encryption.
Since Iâ€™m not very familiar with using GitHub, I will only upload the key files. Please forgive me.
